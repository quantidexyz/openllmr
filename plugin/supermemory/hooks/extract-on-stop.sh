# Stop hook — extract durable memories from the most recent exchange and
# persist them. Replaces the old UserPromptSubmit-time extractor, which
# saved off a single user message before the assistant ever responded —
# which meant speculation and rejected proposals could land in memory as
# if they were the user's conclusion.
#
# Why Stop instead of UserPromptSubmit
# ────────────────────────────────────
# By the time Stop fires, the latest exchange is *finished*: we can see the
# user's statement, the assistant's response, AND any follow-up the user
# made (corrections, "yes do that", "no stop"). That's the signal needed to
# distinguish "the user actually concluded X" from "the user floated X and
# the conversation moved on."
#
# What this hook does
# ───────────────────
# 1. Reads the Stop event JSON: transcript_path, session_id, cwd.
# 2. Derives the project slug from cwd (git-root basename, slugified;
#    falls back to cwd basename). No more global "default" bucket.
# 3. Throttles: skips if the transcript byte size hasn't grown since the
#    last extraction for this session. Stop fires often; we don't.
# 4. Pulls the last N messages from the transcript JSONL and the top
#    existing memories for this project.
# 5. Pre-fetches the user's team list (/whoami) and known project slugs
#    (/projects) so the extractor LLM can ROUTE each save to one or more
#    destinations.
# 6. Asks the extractor LLM to emit BOTH save and forget candidates:
#       - save: {content, destinations: [{project?, team?}, ...]} — the
#               dialogue confirmed the item AND the model picked which
#               bucket(s) it belongs to (personal project, default,
#               and/or a team the user is in).
#       - forget: existing memories the latest exchange contradicts or
#                 supersedes. Lets memory evolve as the user's stance does.
# 7. Applies save+forget against the gateway, fanning out per destination.
